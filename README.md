# Python_for_Machine_Learning
Basic and advanced implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms in Python.

In the folder Data Analysis and Visualization. the summary of the basic knowledge that I learned  about the important python libraries such as pandas and seaborn for data analysis were presented. 
In the Capstone Project using the basic knowledge we acquired about data analysis we tried to answer the question whether there is a conflict of interest of a website that both sells movie tickets and displays movie ratings.
it's been suspected that the website named Fandango overrates its movies in order to sell more movie tickects. For this reason we used data analysis to confirm or deny this suspicion.
we compared the true ratings that Fandango holds in the backend and those that it actually displays the users to check for any discrepancies.also we compared with the ratings of other websites such as rotten tomatoes. in the end we reached the conclusion that the Fandango ratings are obviously too high even for movies that were poorly rated by other rating websites like TAKEN 3.
